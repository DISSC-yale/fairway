# Repository Governance Rules

This repository has automated rule enforcement. rules are defined in `rules.md` (local) and inherited from `llm-agentic-notes`.

## Key Local Rules

1. **RULE-100**: CLI should have a `fairway build` command.
2. **RULE-102**: `fairway run` must NOT launch Nextflow (it is a worker).
3. **RULE-106**: Templates must be static files in `src/fairway/data/`.
4. **RULE-107**: Spark version (4.1.1) must be consistent across files.

## Project Structure (Inherited)

- **Agents**: Placed in `agents/<domain>/` (RULE-003)
- **Naming**: No `-agent.md` suffix (RULE-001)

## Validation Commands

To check rules, run:
```bash
agentic-governance --all
```
